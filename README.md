# Patched Chat App (v2)

Improvements added in v2:
- Multi-page structure: login, rooms, chat, friends, profile, settings.
- Client-side auth with embedded admin account (for demo only).
- Friend system, rooms, messages stored in localStorage.
- Added sample avatars, profile and settings pages.
- Added a tiny Node server stub (server.js + package.json) for optional local server testing.
- Includes additional sample messages and assets.

Security note: This is a client-side demo. Do not use in production. Admin credentials are embedded for convenience.
